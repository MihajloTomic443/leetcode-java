LeetCode #35 - Search Insert Position

Difficulty: Easy
Topic: Binary Search

Time Complexity: O(log n)
Space Complexity: O(1)

Idea:
Perform a standard binary search.
If the target is found, return its index.
Otherwise, when the search interval becomes empty,
the left pointer represents the correct insertion position.

Learned:
- Binary Search can be used even when the target is not present.
- When the search ends, left points to the insertion index.
- Always update boundaries with mid + 1 or mid - 1.
- Binary Search is useful for finding positions, not only exact values.
