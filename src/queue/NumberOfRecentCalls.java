/*
 * LeetCode 933 - Number of Recent Calls
 *
 * Idea:
 * Maintain a queue containing only the requests that occurred within
 * the last 3000 milliseconds. Every new request is added to the queue,
 * and all outdated requests are removed from the front since timestamps
 * are strictly increasing. The remaining queue size represents the
 * number of recent requests.
 *
 * Time Complexity:
 * ping() -> O(1) amortized
 *
 * Space Complexity:
 * O(n)
 *
 * Learned:
 * - Learned how to use Queue for sliding window style problems.
 * - Practiced Queue operations: offer(), poll(), peek(), size(), isEmpty().
 * - Understood why timestamps being strictly increasing allows removing
 *   outdated requests only from the front of the queue.
 * - Learned how LeetCode "Design" problems work using constructors and
 *   instance variables that preserve state across multiple method calls.
 * - Saw another example of amortized analysis: every request is added
 *   exactly once and removed at most once.
